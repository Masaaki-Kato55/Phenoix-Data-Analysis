# Phenoix Data Analysis / Dashboard

## Introduction
- This project was inspired after reading this [article](https://azpbs.org/horizon/2022/01/arizonas-housing-shortage-is-making-for-higher-home-prices/), which details the severe housing shortage Arizona is currently experiencing. 
- To investigate possible explanations, I decided to look at changes in Arizona throughout this past decade.
 - I explored US Census Bureau data on Arizona. The datasets span from demographics, economics, and housing data. The datasets can be found [here](https://www.phoenixopendata.com/organization/external-data).
    - The original datasets can be found in `data/original`
    - The modified datasets can be found in `data/cleaned`
- All analysis and graphics were conducted using R.
    - There is both a pdf version of the Rmd file in the main directory and the original Rmd file under `code`
- Additionally, I compiled my results in a dashboard, which can be accessed [here](https://rpubs.com/mkato124/871541)
    - The code for this dashboard is also under `code`

## Finding
- The median income increased $10,000 in this past decade, while the median gross rent has increased $200. 
    - To put this into perspective, the US median is $1,097 in 2019 and the NY median is #1,309 ([source](https://www.deptofnumbers.com/rent/new-york/))
- Occupied housing units have soared in this past decade, while vacant housing units have dropped at a similar pace. This suggests that the bought homes go straight to the consumer rather than large corporations
- Concerning education, there are increases across multiple degrees (Bachelor, associate, masters, GED)
- The age demographic is relatively stable in this past decade with a slight increase in the older generations.
- Poverty levels have also dropped with more people above the poverty line and less below the poverty line.
- Overall, there is nothing in the general data to suggest a housing shortage
- However, the data does suggest a general population growth and prosperity. This may mean that Pheonix has become a more attractive destination.
